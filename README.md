## The assignment I used

The chosen assignment is the Responsive restauraunt menu (see [here](https://github.com/Karinliu/css-to-the-rescue-1819/blob/master/assignments/menu.html)
 the link).

## Two restrictions

The two restrictions I used are: 
* Two colours
* No squares, no rectangles, no circles, no triangles

## How did I start?

Before I started with the assignment, I have made a design for the restaurant menu website. See below the design.
